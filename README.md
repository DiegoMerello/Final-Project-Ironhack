## Project Description
The last project of the Data Analytics Part Time Bootcamp consists to show tungsten price evolution and daily price of aluminum, iron, tin, tungsten and copper.

The metals price is shown in Streamlit app through a shared link. The app will be updated every time it's open. The metal price are taken from Metals-API, and unfortunately, there is a 50 calls per month.

## Built with

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
